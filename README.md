# Quiz-TIme

A brand new game where the rules are made up and the points don't matter.

Are you there, player one? If so, you are probably the last one standing. Now, perhaps you will succeed where the others have failed. You think you will walk away untested? I promise that my work will continue. You think it's over just because I am new. It's not over. The games have just begun.

Please, enjoy my timed test! But can you make it to the end with a perfect score? If you think that you can, then by all means...play :)
